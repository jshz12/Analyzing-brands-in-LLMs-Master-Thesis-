### Analyzing Brand Perception in LLMs

This thesis investigates brand perception in different Large Language Models (LLMs),
focusing on three brands: Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. We first established an understanding of brand perception and the construction of psychometrically sound
tests. Leveraging this foundation, we defined four metrics across two dimensions,
sentiment and preference, to facilitate a comprehensive analysis. In the sentiment
dimension, we observed that the Gemma LLM exhibited consistent bias across all
brands, whereas ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 displayed similar behavior for Apple
and Samsung, with notable differences for Huawei. In the preference dimension,
all studied LLMs demonstrated transitivity consistency, consistently preferring Apple over Samsung and Samsung over Huawei. Our findings highlight the potential
for extensive analysis using the defined metrics, limited here by time constraints.
We suggest several avenues for future research, including expanding the range of
brands and LLMs analyzed, improving the question bank through collaboration
with psychologists, and incorporating varied question connotations and mask questions to enrich the studyâ€™s depth. This study provides a methodological framework
for assessing brand perception in LLMs, with implications for broader applications
beyond the specific brands and models examined.
